What is root user?
    Root user is a super user who has all the privileges/full control over the system. Manages other users in the system.

What is PATH?
    PATH environment variable ‚Äî a list of directories the shell checks for commands.
    echo $PATH shows the PATH variable.
    Example output:
    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
    So when you type a command, Linux looks in these folders to find it.

What is VIM?
    VIM is the text editor in Linux environment.
    Use it to create or edit files in the terminal.
    Basic commands:

    i ‚Üí insert mode (start typing)

    Esc ‚Üí exit insert mode

    :w ‚Üí save

    :q ‚Üí quit

    :wq ‚Üí save and quit

    :q! ‚Üí quit without saving

As a root user can you restore or decrypt the password of a user ?

    No all the passwords are one way encrypted , hence the decryption is not possible.

What is the difference b/w the useradd and adduser ?
    useradd -> A simplest form of creating the user and it's doesn't get many information about the user and doesn't create directory in home directory for the user. Used for running the scripts 

    adduser -> Gets more information about the user while creating the user and also creates the directory in the home directory for the user.

What is SSH client ?
    An SSH client is a tool that lets you connect securely to another machine (like a server) using the SSH protocol.

    It handles:

    * Authentication (e.g., key or password)
    * Encryption of data
    * Remote command execution

    Example:

    * Linux/macOS: built-in `ssh`
    * Windows: `ssh` (via Git Bash or PowerShell), or tools like PuTTY

    

How to connect with the linux server which is in the AWS EC2 ?
    Use  a SSH client ( GIT Bash ) , In git bash move to the directory where your key pair is presented , The run the command in the ssh client command available in the AWS.

What is primary group and secondary group ?
    * Primary group: Default group for the user; used when creating files.
    * Secondary groups: Extra groups a user can belong to for additional access.

    Example:

    ```bash
    id username
    ```

    Shows:

    * `gid=...` ‚Üí Primary group
    * `groups=...` ‚Üí All groups (primary + secondary)

What is user management and file permissions ?

    User Management = Creating users & groups

    File Permissions = Controlling what users can read, write, or execute on files/directories

Did Linux comes with the file permissions by default ?

    By default linux provides basic rules so that file permissions is maintained. Example :- You can see the other user directory and the file in the directory . You can also read the content in that file but updating or deleting the file is not permitted. You need permissions for that. 

    You can modify the file permission based on your requirement using the chmod command. 

What happens when a user is created ?
    Default a group with the same name as the user is created. This is called a user private group.

    Why?
        It improves permission handling:

        User gets their own group

        Easier collaboration and access control

        Helps in managing file ownership and sharing

        It's a standard practice in Linux systems for flexibility and security.

In file permissions what does ' 1 user group 1234 Mar 28 10:00 myfile.sh' explains ?

    Let‚Äôs break down -rwxr--r-- 1 user group 1234 Mar 28 10:00 myfile.sh in depth:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ -rwxr--r--
    This is the file permission string, 1-rwxr--r--0 characters:

    Part	Meaning
    -	File type ‚Üí - means a regular file
    rwx	Owner's permissions ‚Üí read, write, execute
    r--	Group's permissions ‚Üí read-only
    r--	Others' permissions ‚Üí read-only

    So:

    Owner can read, write, and execute.

    Group can read only.

    Others can read only.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ 1
    This is the hard link count ‚Äî number of directory entries (links) pointing to this file.

    3Ô∏è‚É£ user
    This is the owner (user) of the file.

    4Ô∏è‚É£ group
    This is the group that owns the file.

    5Ô∏è‚É£ 1234
    This is the file size in bytes.

    6Ô∏è‚É£ Mar 28 10:00
    This is the last modification date and time of the file.

    7Ô∏è‚É£ myfile.sh
    This is the file name

How to create a shell script ?

    --> Create a shell file [ touch file.sh ]
    --> Write a shebang Line and the script
        --> Shebang (#!) is the first line in a script that tells the system which interpreter to use.
        [ #!/bin/bash
          echo "Hello, World!"]
    --> Execute using './file.sh'

Explain --> chmod u=rxw file.sh
        chmod u=rwx <filename>
    Breakdown:
        chmod: Change file permissions.

        u: Refers to user (owner) , o: Refers to other users , g: Refers to groups 

        =: Assign exactly these permissions.

        rwx:

        r = read

        w = write

        x = execute

Consider you have only the execution permission and don't have read permission for shell file , can you execute the file ?
    Even though you have execute permission , they also need read access to read the script content (shell scripts must be readable to be run).

Can I get into other's directory only with the read permission ?
    No, with the help of read permission for a directory you can just list the files in the directory and you can't enter into that directory. Even you can't read the file contents in that directory

    To get into the other's directory you should also need the execute permission for that directory.

    Directory permissions and file permissions are completely independent.
    
Important Differences from Directories:

| Permission | Directory | File |
|------------|-----------|------|
| r | List directory contents | Read file contents |
| w | Create/delete files inside | Modify file contents |
| x | Enter directory (cd) | Run file as program |

Explain file permissions and folder permissions in depth :-
    Directory Permission Requirements:
    To access any file, you need AT MINIMUM:

    Execute (x) permission on the directory
    Execute (x) permission on ALL parent directories in the path

    Possible Combinations:
    1. Directory: r+x, File: r ‚úÖ
    bash# Directory: 755, File: 644
    ls /dir          # ‚úÖ Can list directory
    cd /dir          # ‚úÖ Can enter directory  
    cat /dir/file    # ‚úÖ Can read file

    2. Directory: r+x, File: no read ‚ùå
    bash# Directory: 755, File: 600 (you're not owner)
    ls /dir          # ‚úÖ Can list directory
    cd /dir          # ‚úÖ Can enter directory
    cat /dir/file    # ‚ùå Permission denied - no file read permission

    3. Directory: x only, File: r ‚úÖ (if you know filename)
    bash# Directory: 711, File: 644
    ls /dir          # ‚ùå Cannot list directory contents
    cd /dir          # ‚úÖ Can enter directory
    cat /dir/file    # ‚úÖ Can read file (if you know the exact name)

    4. Directory: r only, File: r ‚ùå
    bash# Directory: 644, File: 644
    ls /dir          # ‚úÖ Can see filenames
    cd /dir          # ‚ùå Cannot enter directory
    cat /dir/file    # ‚ùå Cannot access file path [ To reach the file you should go through the directory but you don't even has the permission to enter into the directory then how it possible to reach the file ]

    5. Directory: w+x, File: r ‚úÖ
    bash# Directory: 733, File: 644
    ls /dir          # ‚ùå Cannot list contents
    cd /dir          # ‚úÖ Can enter directory
    cat /dir/file    # ‚úÖ Can read file (if you know name)
    rm /dir/file     # ‚úÖ Can delete file (directory write permission!)

    Key Insights:
        Directory execute (x) is mandatory - without it, you cannot access any files inside, regardless of file permissions.
        Dangerous combination: Directory w+x, File read-only

        You can delete files even if you can't read them!
        Directory write permission overrides file permissions for deletion

    Stealth access: Directory x only
        Can access files if you know exact names
        Cannot discover what files exist
        Useful for "hidden" file sharing

# Linux Command Line Basics

## What is sudo?  
üîπ **sudo (Super User DO)**  
- Allows a normal user to run commands with superuser (root) privileges  
- It asks for your password, not root's  
- Commonly used for admin tasks (e.g., install software, modify system files)  

Example:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
Runs the apt update command as root.

## What is bash?  
üîπ **bash (Bourne Again SHell)**  
- A command-line interpreter (shell)  
- It reads your commands and executes them  
- Supports scripting (loops, variables, functions)  
- Most common default shell in Linux  

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello"
```
This script runs with bash.

## What is su?  
üîπ **su (Substitute User or Switch User)**  
- Lets you switch to another user, usually root  
- By default: su = switch to root  
- It asks for the target user's password  

Example:
```bash
su
```
Switches to root (you need the root password).

## What is -l?  
üîπ **-l (Login shell)**  
- Used with su or bash  
- Gives a login environment, like when you log in freshly  
- Loads user's profile files (.bash_profile, .profile)  

Example:
```bash
su -l username
```
Switches to username with a full login environment.

## What is | and why it's used for?  
üîπ **| (Pipe)**  
- Sends output of one command as input to another  
- Used to combine commands  

Example:
```bash
ls | grep file
```
Lists files and filters those with the word file.


What is the sudoers file?
    It‚Äôs a configuration file that controls who can use sudo and what commands they can run.

What is apt?
    apt = Advanced Package Tool

    Used for: Installing, updating, and removing software on Debian-based Linux (like Ubuntu).

Why sudo su doesn't ask root password, but su does?

    ‚úÖ sudo su
    Uses your own password.

    You're authorized via sudoers file.

    Once verified, it switches to root without asking root‚Äôs password.

    üîí su
    Tries to switch directly to root.

    Needs root's actual password.

    ‚úÖ So:

    sudo su = You‚Äôre trusted via sudo.

    su = You must know root‚Äôs password.

What is the difference between ps aux and ps ef and ps ec ?
    | Command  | Style | Shows                                                |
| -------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `ps aux` | BSD   | All processes + resource usage                       |
| `ps -ef` | UNIX  | All processes + full info (PPID, time, full command) |
| `ps -ec` | UNIX  | All processes + only command name                    |

What is the difference between the process and the services?

üîß Process
    Definition: A process is any instance of a program that is being executed.
    Started by: A user or the system.
    Runs in: User mode or system mode.
    Lifetime: Exists as long as the program runs.
    Visibility: Usually visible in the task manager or process list (e.g., ps on Linux, Task Manager on Windows).
    Examples: Opening a web browser, running a Python script, launching a video game.

üõéÔ∏è Service
    Definition: A special kind of process designed to run in the background, often without user interaction.
    Started by: Automatically by the operating system or manually by a user/admin.
    Runs in: Typically system mode.
    Lifetime: May run continuously in the background even without user login.
    Managed by: Service managers like systemd (Linux), services.msc (Windows).
    Examples: Print spooler, web server (Apache/Nginx), database service (MySQL).
